# Homeremote Plugins

Monorepo for the plugins for [Homeremote](https://github.com/mdvanes/homeremote).

Plugins are comprised of a client and a server package. The client package exposes a React component (potentially wrapped around a different component, like in Elm). 

The server package exposes a function that can be used in a Node server, for instance in [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) controllers.
